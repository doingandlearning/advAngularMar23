Angular CLI is a command-line interface tool that helps developers create and manage Angular projects. It is built on top of the Node.js platform and provides a convenient way to automate many of the common tasks associated with Angular development. Here are some notes on how to use Angular CLI and its most common use cases:

# Installation: 
You can install Angular CLI using npm, which is a package manager for Node.js. To install it globally, run the following command in your terminal: npm install -g @angular/cli

# Creating a new project: 
To create a new Angular project using CLI, navigate to the directory where you want to create the project and run the following command: ng new <project-name>. This will create a new project with the specified name in the current directory.

# Generating components: 
To generate a new component in your Angular project, you can use the ng generate component <component-name> command. This will create a new component with the specified name, along with its associated files and folders.

# Building the project:
To build your Angular project, run the ng build command. This will compile your project into JavaScript files and store them in the dist/ folder.

# Running the project: 
To run your Angular project, use the ng serve command. This will start a development server and open your project in your default browser.

# Creating a production build: 
To create a production build of your Angular project, run the ng build --prod command. This will optimize your project for production and create a minimized version of your JavaScript files.

# Generating a new service: 
To generate a new service in your Angular project, use the ng generate service <service-name> command. This will create a new service with the specified name, along with its associated files and folders.

# Running tests: 
To run tests for your Angular project, use the ng test command. This will run your tests using the Karma test runner.

# Updating Angular CLI: 
To update your Angular CLI tool to the latest version, run the npm install -g @angular/cli command again. This will update your CLI tool to the latest version available on npm.

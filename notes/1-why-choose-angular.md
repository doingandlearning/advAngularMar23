Why are teams choosing Angular? Here are a few reasons:

1. Robustness: Angular is a full-fledged framework that comes with a complete set of tools and features, making it a great choice for complex projects. Its opinionated structure and powerful tooling make it easier to build large-scale, maintainable applications.

2. Google backing: Angular is backed by Google, one of the most influential players in the tech industry. This means that Angular is likely to continue receiving support and updates for the foreseeable future, giving teams a sense of security in their choice of technology.

3. TypeScript integration: Angular is built with TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, interfaces, and other features to the language. This makes it easier to catch errors at compile-time and write more maintainable code.

4. Adoption: Despite the popularity of other front-end frameworks like React and Vue, Angular still has a significant market share. According to a 2021 Stack Overflow survey, Angular was the third most commonly used web framework, with 23.5% of respondents reporting that they use it regularly.

5. Developer experience: Angular's tooling, including the Angular CLI, makes it easy to create, test, and deploy applications. It also has a well-documented and organized code structure that makes it easier for developers to work on large projects with teams. Additionally, the Angular community provides a wealth of resources and support for developers to learn and improve their skills.

6. Community: Angular has a large and active community of developers, which means there are plenty of resources available for learning, problem-solving, and sharing knowledge. The community also contributes to the development of Angular through bug reporting, feature requests, and open-source contributions, making it a collaborative and inclusive ecosystem for developers of all levels.

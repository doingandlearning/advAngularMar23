The base Angular project structure created by ng new command has a standardized directory structure that provides a foundation for building scalable and maintainable applications. Here are some notes on the key components of this structure:

- node_modules: This folder contains all the dependencies required by your Angular project. These dependencies are installed automatically when you run npm install.

- src: This folder contains the source code for your Angular application, including HTML, CSS, and TypeScript files.

- app: This folder contains the root module of your application, as well as the components, services, and other features that make up your app. This is where you'll spend most of your time developing your application.

- index.html: This file is the entry point for your Angular application and contains the HTML code that loads your app's JavaScript files.

- main.ts: This file is the entry point for your Angular application's TypeScript code and bootstraps your app.

- styles.css: This file contains the global styles for your Angular application. Could also be *.scss or *.sass depending on your CSS choices.

- angular.json: This file contains the configuration options for your Angular project, including build and serve options.

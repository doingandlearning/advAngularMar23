# *ngIf:

- *ngIf is a structural directive in Angular that conditionally adds or removes elements from the DOM based on an expression.
- The expression is evaluated to a boolean value, and if it's true, the element is added to the DOM; otherwise, it's removed.
- *ngIf can be used with any HTML element or Angular component.
- When *ngIf is false, the element is not only removed from the DOM, but also its associated component is destroyed, meaning that its lifecycle hooks are called with the appropriate events.

# `[disabled]`:

- [disabled] is a property binding in Angular that disables an HTML element or an Angular component.
- The value of [disabled] is usually a boolean expression, and if it's true, the element or component is disabled; otherwise, it's enabled.
- [disabled] is often used with buttons and form inputs to prevent the user from interacting with them when a certain condition is met.
- When an element or component is disabled, it's usually styled differently to indicate to the user that it's not interactive.

# `[hidden]`:

- [hidden] is also a property binding in Angular that hides an HTML element or an Angular component.
- The value of [hidden] is usually a boolean expression, and if it's true, the element or component is hidden; otherwise, it's visible.
- Unlike *ngIf, [hidden] doesn't remove the element or component from the DOM. Instead, it sets its CSS display property to none, effectively hiding it from the user.
- [hidden] is often used with elements that need to be hidden or shown dynamically without affecting the rest of the layout.
